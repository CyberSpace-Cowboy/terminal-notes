# Terminal Notes

This is a very primitive note-taking app that works in the terminal. I wrote it in less than 15 minutes using Python.


## Implementation 

It's implemented in a very trivial way:

1. It just creates text files in the same directory as the program
2. You can specify the name of the note (i.e. the name of the text file)
3. You can specify the title of the note (i.e. the header of the text file)
4. You can type your notes, and when finished you should double press [Enter]


To run this stupid little program you should open the terminal at the same directory as your Notes.py program, and then type:
```
python Notes.py  
```

P.S. I know that it's definitely not the most convinient note-taking app to use, and the standard "TextEdit" that ships with MacOS and 
"Notepad" that ships with Windows are much better in terms of features (I'm not even talking about OneNote, Evernote, etc),
but I still prefer to take notes in a terminal for some reason...
